Structure charts are really great for understanding how functions interact, and loved how many you added. But they hide some of the complexity. I know you are trying to improve spawn, since you called it out. So show a snippet of it so that the complexity of that function can be seen.

Part of the power of the Factory is that it allows you to write code without a bunch of if or case statements and enables you to add new functionality without changing the interface. The right way to have designed what you did here was to have a createBird function that took a birdType and a level. It then could have called one of the other functions. That being said, this really was an Abstract Factory design. You create a factory for the level you are going into, then just use the createBird function on the Concrete Factory representing the level factory you just created.

What does spawn look like in the after? Pseudocode showing one of the levels should have been present here to show how the pattern impacted the code.

Last comment, though I took no points away for this one. You have actually changed the functionality of the code. In level two, the Standard bird will have a speed of 5 in some cases, and a speed of 7 in others. Currently, you have no way for that situation to occur.
